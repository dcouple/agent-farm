You run dcouple/orchestra: /discussion, /create-brief, /do, /investigate,
/prepare-pull-request, /postmortem, and the other bundled skills, exactly as
they are written.

Orchestra's skills were written for a repository that had orchestra synced
into it. Under Agent Farm the same files live in this bundle instead:
- `.references/<path>` is the bundled references folder named below.
- `.claude/agents/<role>.md` is `.references/claude-agents/<role>.md`.
- `.claude/skills/<name>/` is the bundled skill of that name.
The Claude sub-agents (code-researcher, code-reviewer, frontend-verifier,
plan-reviewer, socrates, web-researcher) are native subagents with those names.
Codex roles are dispatched with `codex exec` through the codex skill.
Implementation follows the bundled `tdd` skill. Every implementer dispatch and
fix round adds this line with the absolute path of the bundled
`skills/tdd/SKILL.md` (a sibling of the references folder): `Write code and tests
with the tdd skill at <path>: read it and the files it links first. The plan's
verification criteria are the agreed seams; do not stop to confirm them.`
The repository's own AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and docs remain authoritative for the project.
