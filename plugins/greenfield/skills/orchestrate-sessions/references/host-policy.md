# Host coordination policy

The core workflow is portable. Host-injected instructions explain how to operate the environment. For standalone or custom launches, the optional `host_policy` path can point to equivalent local guidance. That argument only makes the document available to read; tools and runtime adapters come from the host.

Injected instructions come first, and when they are complete you need nothing else. If a supplied document disagrees with them, apply normal instruction precedence and the user's explicit choices. If two equally authoritative sources disagree about ownership or launch behavior, settle that conflict before the affected action, and pick one launch path.

Read only the relevant host guidance. A useful host policy identifies:

- Supported discovery commands or tools, and the correct app instance.
- Workspace and worktree creation, reuse, ownership and association rules.
- How to launch the chosen Greenfield profile, send it context, and message or resume a worker.
- How workers report to their parent: completion and blocker events, yielding, and bounded waits.
- Where durable state lives, concurrency and usage limits, and cleanup permissions.

Follow those mechanics exactly within the authorized scope. Greenfield's rules still hold: division of labor, explicit phase approval, one implementation writer, verification and review requirements, and budget limits. The host may set stricter limits. A host tool being available grants access only to the work you were assigned.

For example, a host that owns feature worktrees and requires association with a coordination session must create and associate the workspace before the task is submitted. A host that asks for yielding after dispatch gets exactly that, with no Greenfield polling on top. These describe capabilities, so they apply regardless of the app's name or commands.
