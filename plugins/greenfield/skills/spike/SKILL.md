# Spike

A spike answers one question so a decision can be made. It is not a comfort step. Do not write one for every feature.

## Steps

1. Write the question so the answer is a fact, not an opinion. "Can the queue delay a job by 24 hours without a new table?" is a spike. "What is the best queue design?" is an options question.
2. Set a time box and a method. Throwaway code is allowed and expected.
3. If the question is answerable from the web or docs, send it to `researcher`. If it needs the repo or a running system, send it to `investigator`. Give the child the question and the time box only.
4. Record the answer and the evidence.
5. Feed the answer back into the options document under "What we learned". Re-rank the options if it changes them.

## Format

Plain text in the worktree, for example `docs/agent/spikes/{slug}.md`:

```
# Spike: {one question}
Blocks: {which decision and options}
Time box:
Method:
Throwaway allowed: yes

## Done when
An answer, not a feature.

## Answer
## Evidence
Feeds back to: {options link}
```

## Banned

- Merging spike code into the real plan automatically. If spike code should ship, it becomes a work package like any other.
- Widening the question after starting
