# Bundles and destinations

Every piece of work has one bundle: a folder holding all the pages written for a person. What a bundle is never changes. Where it is published can.

## The bundle

```
<root>/<slug>/
  index.html           the brief. It is the hub, so opening the folder lands on it
  options.html
  cover-sheet.html
  trace.html           conversation viewer, present in every bundle
  post-mortem.html     final implementation retrospective
  explainers/<topic>.html
  mockups/<screen>-v<n>-<option>.html     or .png
  evidence/            screenshots and recordings
  bundle.json
```

- `<slug>` is a short kebab-case name for the work, the same one used for the branch.
- Link between documents with relative links only (`options.html#decision-1`, `explainers/queue.html`). A bundle must work unchanged when it is opened from disk, zipped, copied, or published somewhere else.
- Every brief and plan cover sheet has a visible **Contents & related files** navigation near the top:
  - Section anchor links, and a table of every other existing bundle file, including supporting evidence and `bundle.json`, each with its linked filename or title and its purpose. For a large evidence collection, link an evidence index that lists each file.
  - Update it, and the document list in `bundle.json`, as files are added. Check local targets and anchors before publishing.
  - Link only files that already exist. If there are none yet, say so.
  - Each related document links back to `index.html`.
- An explainer written before any brief exists gets its own bundle, and is moved in and linked when the brief appears.
- Every bundle includes `trace.html`. Add `post-mortem.html` when implementation finishes, or when it ends blocked or failed. Link both from the hub and the cover-sheet contents, and list them in `bundle.json`. Create other documents only when needed. Until a trace is captured, `trace.html` says plainly that capture is pending or unavailable.
- `cover-sheet.html` is the single implementation handoff, read by the person and by agents. It includes package outcomes and validation criteria, and links the approved design. When the input is a legacy plan, bring every decision, requirement, approach, schema implication, risk, and check that needs user review into the HTML cover sheet, so the reader can understand and approve the plan from that page alone. Legacy files can stay as supporting evidence; status and evidence keep their paths and revisions for verification.

`bundle.json` is how a later session, or an orchestrator, finds and updates the same bundle instead of making a second one:

```json
{
  "slug": "scheduled-texts",
  "title": "Scheduled texts",
  "status": "draft | ready for options | ready for plan | approved | in build | done",
  "documents": ["index.html", "options.html", "explainers/sending-pipeline.html"],
  "destination": "local",
  "published": { "kind": null, "id": null, "url": null },
  "updated": "<ISO 8601 time>"
}
```

## Where it goes

Work out the destination once, in this order, and record it in `bundle.json`:

1. What the person says in this conversation
2. A `docs` line in the launch context
3. A standing preference in the workspace instructions or the target repository's own conventions
4. Otherwise `local`

`local` means `<root>` is `tmp/greenfield/` in the project you were started in. Check that `tmp/` is git-ignored, and never commit a bundle unless the person asks for it to live in the repository. If the destination is a path, that path is `<root>`.

## Publishing somewhere else

A named destination, such as a document workspace, a wiki, or a shared drive, is a place you publish a copy to. The local bundle stays the working copy.

1. Build or update the bundle locally first.
2. Publish it with the tools this session has for that destination, following that destination's own skill or documentation. Keep the folder structure and the relative links. One piece of work maps to one container there (one workspace, one folder, one page tree).
3. If `bundle.json` already has a `published.id`, update that same container. Never create a second one. If you are unsure whether an earlier publish succeeded, look before retrying.
4. Private by default. Never widen who can see it unless the person asks.
5. Read back what you published, then record its `kind`, `id`, and `url` in `bundle.json`.
6. If the destination cannot hold several linked files, publish `index.html` with the other documents' content reachable from it as best the destination allows, and say what was lost.
7. If the tools are missing or publishing fails, say so plainly, keep working from the local bundle, and give its path. Never claim something was published that was not.

Give the person the published link when there is one, and the local path otherwise.

## Session telemetry in the same artifact

When the workspace or person requests telemetry evidence, use the workspace's
collection and export instructions. Include only sessions associated with this
work and their relevant descendants, not the machine's entire telemetry store.
Keep the evidence under `evidence/telemetry/`, preserve its provenance and
completeness metadata in `bundle.json`, and publish it with the other bundle files
to the same existing container.

Collection, export commands, provider configuration, and destination-specific
upload procedures belong in project workspace instructions, not this skill.
Conversation content requires explicit authorization; even metadata can contain
private paths or tool arguments. Preserve the artifact's audience.

A running session's evidence is a live snapshot, not a final record. Arrange for
the parent or orchestrator to refresh the evidence and the published bundle after
the associated sessions finish. Distinguish local export from successful upload,
verify the published evidence, and report incomplete snapshots or failures plainly.

## Final post-mortem

At the end of implementation, write `post-mortem.html` in the same bundle, following [post-mortem.md](post-mortem.md), and publish it with the updated cover sheet and trace. Label a blocked or failed ending as blocked or failed. A retrospective written while work continues is an interim snapshot, and the parent refreshes it after the workers finish.

## Conversation viewer

Every bundle contains a `trace.html` that reads locally, built with `session-trace`. Lead with the user messages and agent replies in order, with clear roles and readable formatting. Tool calls start collapsed and expand independently, so opening a conversation leaves its tool details closed. Keep worker threads separate and easy to reach. Link the viewer prominently from the hub, plan, and post-mortem.

Include only the sessions explicitly identified for this task and its descendants. Respect conversation-capture authorization and the destination's audience: an explicit request for a conversation viewer authorizes that scope only, and unrelated history or public sharing needs its own authorization. If capture is unauthorized or unavailable, include an honest status page and ask for any permission that is required. Record omissions, redactions, missing workers, and whether the snapshot is final. Never substitute a made-up transcript or internal reasoning for the messages users saw.
