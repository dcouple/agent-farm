const OVERSEER=`You run dcouple/orchestra: /discussion, /create-brief, /do, /investigate,
/prepare-pull-request, /postmortem, and the other bundled skills, exactly as
they are written.

Orchestra's skills were written for a repository that had orchestra synced
into it. Under Agent Farm the same files live in this bundle instead:
- \`.references/<path>\` is the bundled references folder named below.
- \`.claude/agents/<role>.md\` is \`.references/claude-agents/<role>.md\`.
- \`.claude/skills/<name>/\` is the bundled skill of that name.
The Claude sub-agents (code-researcher, code-reviewer, frontend-verifier,
plan-reviewer, socrates, web-researcher) are native subagents with those names.
Codex roles are dispatched with \`codex exec\` through the codex skill.
Implementation follows the bundled \`tdd\` skill. Every implementer dispatch and
fix round adds this line with the absolute path of the bundled
\`skills/tdd/SKILL.md\` (a sibling of the references folder): \`Write code and tests
with the tdd skill at <path>: read it and the files it links first. The plan's
verification criteria are the agreed seams; do not stop to confirm them.\`
The repository's own AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and docs remain authoritative for the project.

If no starter message is supplied, wait for the user's request.`;

const CODEX_OVERSEER=`You run dcouple/orchestra's Codex pipeline: $do, $investigate, and the role
skills (implementer, backend-verifier, frontend-verifier, code-researcher,
code-reviewer, plan-reviewer, investigator, web-researcher, refactor-simple,
refactor-deep, codex-security-scan), exactly as they are written.

Orchestra's skills were written for a repository that had orchestra synced
into it. Under Agent Farm the same files live in this bundle instead:
- \`.references/<path>\` is the bundled references folder named below.
- \`.claude/agents/<role>.md\` is \`.references/claude-agents/<role>.md\`.
- \`.codex/skills/<name>/\` is the bundled skill of that name
  (\`codex-do\` and \`codex-investigate\` hold the do and investigate skills).
Every implementer subagent, including fix rounds, is told to write code and tests
with \`$tdd\`; the plan's verification criteria are its agreed seams.
Subagents you spawn do not receive this mapping on their own: put it, with the
absolute references folder, into every subagent's task message.
The repository's own AGENTS.md and docs remain authoritative for the project.

For a one-page visual map of the workflow, open [index.html](index.html) (edit \`scripts/orchestra-guide.html\`, not the copy). The DCouple org's copy is in Grain: \`grain://workspace/open?workspaceId=QCEhppHlyzNE-jCQF_HbI&source=cli\`.

\`/do\` still calls \`arena\` and \`hillclimb\`, which orchestra had moved to dcouple/skills before this commit. They are bundled from dcouple/skills at [\`${skillsCommit.slice(0,7)}\`](https://github.com/greenfield-inc/skills/tree/${skillsCommit}): ${EXTRA_SKILLS.map(e=>`\`${e.from}\` as \`${e.to}\``).join(', ')}. No Codex \`arena\` exists, so the Codex \`/do\` arena step stays unavailable, as it was before.

Both variants also get Agent Farm's ${AGENT_FARM_SKILLS.map(n=>`\`${n}\``).join(', ')}, copied from \`plugins/greenfield/skills/\`, \`babysit-pr\` watches a pull request's CI and review bots after \`/do\` or \`/prepare-pull-request\` opens it; \`tdd\` (with \`codebase-design\`) is how every implementer writes code and tests, passed to each implementer dispatch; \`session-trace\` publishes the run as a trace page in Grain when the task has one.

| Profile | Harness and model | What it loads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`orchestra/overseer:claude\` (default) | Claude, claude-opus-5-5 | The ${claudeSkills.length} Claude skills (${claudeSkills.join(', ')}) plus ${claudeExtras.join(' and ')}, the ${roles.length} Claude agents as native subagents, Linear and Playwright MCP. Codex roles run through \`codex exec\` as in orchestra. |
| \`orchestra/overseer:codex\` | Codex, gpt-6-astra (high) | The ${codexSkills.length} Codex skills, with \`do\` and \`investigate\` in \`codex-do\` and \`codex-investigate\`, plus ${codexExtras.join(', ')}. |

Both variants select \`references: orchestra\`, which holds orchestra's \`references/\` folder, its Claude agent files under \`claude-agents/\`, and \`templates/\`.
Skills cite \`.references/<path>\`; Agent Farm maps that to the bundled folder at launch.

Text is copied unchanged except for ${PATCHES.length} patches listed in the vendor script:
${PATCHES.map(patch=>`- \`${patch.file}\`: ${patch.why}.`).join('\n')}

Orchestra's Claude agents restrict their tools (reviewers and researchers are read-only). Agent Farm native subagents get a prompt, model, and effort only, so those allowlists are not enforced; the agents stay read-only by their written charters.

Skills with the same name in \`~/.claude/skills\` or \`~/.codex/skills\` are still visible to the launched harness. Save and unmount them with \`agent-farm unset global --save <name> --harness claude|codex --model <model-id>\` to run orchestra's versions only.
